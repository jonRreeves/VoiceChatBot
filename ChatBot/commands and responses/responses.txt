I can do many things. I can tell you the time and the date. I can give you a weather report. I can tell you a joke haha. I can open and close programs, and even control them. I can search the internet. I can give you information about movies. If you want some star wars trivia, say Star Wars and I'll link up with the Star Wars API and hit you with some facts.
